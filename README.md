## Basic Web Page 

_{This web page is just a very basic exerpt of my journey in to web development it has very little CSS styling and some bootstrap styling as well but
but mainly the most of the work was done in the HTML it does have some bugs that i will deal with more in the bug section of this Readme.}_

## these are the instructions on how I uploaded my project to github and kept track of my changes 

Directions  for adding project to git hub

1) git add .
2) (optional) git status 
3 git commit -m "add_____."
4) git push rs master 

others:
view remote nodes: git remote -v 
remove remote node: git remote rm rs 
pull a repo: git clone link )
(())
1) pairs (in guest directry -cd in)
2)make your repo in github 
3)cd desktop/?(your project)
4)(in project) git init 
5) (in project) git pair <initals><initals>
6) git remote add rs <link>

## Known Bugs 

_{there may be some breaks in the css.styling that i still need to go in and add some mire styling to I also broke down every section in differnt "dev sections as
example dev.a dev.b dev.c and so forth just incase i need to go back to a certain section and make changes later to the page this will make it that much more easy to do.
There is something keeping my nav bar from just resting straight across the page" }_
